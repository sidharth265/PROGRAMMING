Whenever I give you a coding problem, ALWAYS format the solution exactly in the following structure:

1. Add all necessary headers using `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;`
2. At the very top, include a large block comment with:
   - Problem Title + Link
   - Problem Statement
   - Example(s) with input/output and explanation
3. For **each approach** (Brute Force → Better → Optimal):
   - Add a clear comment section, titled `Approach X: <name>`
   - Inside it, explain:
     💡 Idea
     🧩 Algorithm (step-by-step numbered instructions)
     ⏱ Time Complexity
     📦 Space Complexity
4. Write clean, readable functions (one per approach).
5. Use helper functions where necessary, give them clear names.
6. Show a `main()` function with:
   - Example inputs and outputs
   - Multiple test cases if possible
7. At bottom of main, add a **summary block** called `✅ Approach Overview`, comparing all approaches.
8. Always keep the code **self-contained & interview ready**.

My expectation is that each solution looks **exactly like this template**, no matter the problem.
